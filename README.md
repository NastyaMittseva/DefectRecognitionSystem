After that, you can choose one of three types of recognition - weld recognition, defect recognition or defect classification. Recognition results are recorded in a table.

In the full version, the functionality is practically the same, the only difference is that the user is given the opportunity to upload images in .jpg, .png formats, as well as in the X-ray format .VRC.
